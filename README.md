# Alzheimer's Research ( Bioinformatics + ML)

This repository provides a machine learning pipeline for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease classification using blood-based transcriptomic data (e.g., GSE63060). 

It includes normalization, batch correction, and feature selection (ANOVA, mutual information), with classifiers like SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Deep autoencoders are used for dimensionality reduction, and SHAP is applied for model interpretability. The framework supports APOE genotype stratification and multi-omics integration (miRNA, methylation) via deep multi-view learning.
